A repository for Labs 5 and 6
<<<<<<< HEAD

The first part of the python program prompts the user for their name and saves the input.

The program then prompts the user for their age.
The program then outputs code signifying that "name" is "age" years old.

To use the file open juptyter hub git clone this repository in the command line then open the file and click run on the code.

We chose the do what the fuck you want license because we give no shits about this code.
We used the covenant code of conduct because everyone uses it and it's the standard.
